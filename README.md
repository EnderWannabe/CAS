# CAS

A work in progress. Most files are self-explanatory. Polynomials.py is not, it contains a polnomial class which
represents polynomials as two lists, one of coefficients and one of exponents. It implements addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division with remainder, and for univariate polynomials, a root-finding function (which is currently buggy).
